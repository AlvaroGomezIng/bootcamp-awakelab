                <p class="description">The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing in
                    Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment in which to learn and play soccer. To be a
                    member of NYSL, you must be between the ages of 4 - 12 and reside in a Chicago northside
                    neighborhood. NYSL is ran by a small full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time of
                    parents and previous league members.</p>
